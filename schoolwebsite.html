	<h1>Principal's Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to Pakuranga Heights School</p>

<p>All parents want the very best for their children.</p>
<p>At Pakuranga Heights School this means our school has a commitment to nurture,</p>
<p>guide, inspire and challenge students to find the joy in learning, to build their</p>
<p>skills and understanding, and to make sense of their world</p>
<p>to become confident responsible global citizens. We are extremely proud of the safe,</p>
<p>caring, family environment our school provides. The school has a proud tradition</p>
<p>of being a focal point in the community and has always enjoyed a high level of </p>
<p>community involvement.

<p>By providing our students with an array of opportunities inside and outside the classroom,</p>
<p>we encourage them to not only explore and recognise the diversity of their talents and abilities but to develop essential leadership skills.</p>

<p>Pakuranga Heights School is proud to provide a learning environment that is dedicated to meeting their specific needs.</p>
<p>We are fortunate at this school to have excellent and dedicated staff who work hard</p>
<p>to support and encourage their students. The school community is strong and works</p>
<p>closely with parents to obtain the best outcomes for their children. We believe we</p>
<p>enrol the family, not just the student, and work closely in partnership to obtain</p>
<p>the best possible outcomes.</p>

<strong><p>Fintan Kelly
Principal</strong></p>
