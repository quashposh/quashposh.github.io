<h1>ROBOTS intelligence ? 2019 speetch Josh</h1>
<p>Hello,   I am here today to tell you about robot intelligence.In this speech you will learn what robot intelligence is!!!! 


<p><strong>Intelligence is another word for wise or clever. For example:
<p>If you are good at solving puzzles  you are intelligent!! 

 
<p>Robots are intelligent as well. Some robots even try to trick people into thinking that they are a human, that's when the turing test comes in!!!


<p>The Turing test was developed by Alan Turing in 1950. It is a test of whether robots  can show intelligent behaviour similar to a humans behaviour!!!!!


<p>Some people have a job of seeing if a robot is pretending to be a human or if it is a robot!! They need to know a lot of stuff because they need to ask the right questions to trick the robot!
                    
                     <p>One example of a trick to play on a robot is to
<p>Ask them a statement that 
<P>Is not true.  The robot will get confused and blows its cover.

<p>Have you heard of the google assistant? 
<p>If you ask it a question it well give you the answer. That is robot intelligence.

<p>Did you know that there is a such thing as a self driving car!
<p>A robot drives the car instead of you.  For example 
<p>A robot   driving a car would not crash as much as a human driving because it won't speed.  


<p>Alan turing asked the question,  can robots think?  
<p>What do you think?</strong>
